Various matlab scripts. These include both a 2D and 3D bouncing ball simulation 
implemented with basic physics including gravity and friction. Updates in real time. 
A Billiards simulation that realistically simulates a pool table interaction using the 
correct physics. And most impressive an image de-noising script that takes an image, adds some noise to it, then 
diffuses it using the Perona Malik diffusion algorithm to blur it back close to its origin form.
